			<p>Creation of <a href="http://eclipse.org/gmt/modisco/">MoDisco</a> component under GMT.</p>
			<p>
			MoDisco (for Model Discovery) is an Eclipse GMT component for model-driven reverse engineering. 
			The objective is to allow practical extractions of models from legacy systems. Because of the widely different 
			nature and technological heterogeneity of legacy systems, there are several different ways to extract models from 
			such systems. MoDisco proposes a generic and extensible metamodel-driven approach to model discovery. A basic 
			framework and a set of guidelines are provided to the Eclipse contributors to bring their own solutions to 
			discover models in various kinds of legacy.
